# Car_Repair_Agent
This project will take the lessons learned from my first RAG model and apply them to make a real-world chatbot. I have been having car troubles for about a year now and being mechanically challenged has prevented me from fixing it. The manual is over 10,000 pages, which is why I need an Agent to read it and answer my questions with references.
